Advent of Code - 2021
=====================

Some solutions for [Advent of Code - 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

The current ambition is just to have some fun.

Potential ambitions under consideration:

 * Keep pace, solve the daily puzzle on the day it is posted.
 * Try to make parallel rather than sequential solutions.
 * Set a time box of max 1 hour per day, so that I don't overthink it.
 * Each day is solved in a language different from the previous day,
   no language must be used more than twice during the event.
 * Each day is solved in two different languages.
 * Stream discussion of some solutions a couple of times per week
   during the event.
 * Find somebody to discuss solutions with. (If you are reading this
   feel free to contact me.)
