Advent of Code - 2021
=====================

Some solutions for [Advent of Code, 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

The ambitions for the event ended up as:

 * Keep pace, solve both parts of the daily puzzle on the day it is
   posted.
 * Set a time box of max 1 hour per day.
 * Try to make parallel rather than sequential solutions.
 * Have some fun

I also had some other ambitions that I partially gave up on:

 * Each day is solved in a language different from the previous day,
   no language must be used more than twice during the event.
 * Each day is solved in two different languages.
 * Stream discussion of some solutions a couple of times per week
   during the event.
 * Find somebody to discuss solutions with. (Some students where nice
   and let me join their Discord server.)

See [my notes](./notes.md) for a log of reflections for the daily
puzzles (contains spoilers).

I have tried to leave my first implementations as they where during
the event. But for some days I've added alternative (usually improved)
solutions, or implementations in different languages.
